# KNN
# Predict a price range of mobile phones, indicating how high the price is, using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. 
# Steps:
## 1.Loading the dataset
##   Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe.

## 2.Data-Preprocessing

## 2.1.Handling missing values
## Check if there are any missing values in the dataset. If there are any missing values, handle them using techniques like imputation.

## 2.2.Handling outliers
## Check if there are any outliers in the dataset.

## 2.3.Feature Scaling using Standardscalar
## Scale the features using StandardScaler.

## 2.4.Checking for imbalaned dataset
## Check if the dataset is imbalanced. If it is imbalanced, handle it using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

## 3.EDA
## Perform exploratory data analysis to get insights about the dataset.

## 4.Splitting the dataset into train and test
## Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## 5.Building the model
## 5.1.Predicting
## Train a K-Nearest Neighbors model on the training set and use it to predict the price range on the testing set.
## 5.2.Performance metrics
## Evaluate the performance of the model using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## 5.3.Chossing optimum k value
## Choose the optimum value of k by plotting the error rate against different values of k and selecting the value of k that gives the lowest error rate.
